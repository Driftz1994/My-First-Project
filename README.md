    Adam Negron <br>
    Overview/description: Website showcasing fictional restaurant <br>
    Website was created with ease of accessibility in mind for the user while maintaining accessibility. <br>
    Technologies Used ( .html , .css ) <br>
    Ideas for future improvement: <br>
     - Use of other media such as animations and videos in use with the project. <br>
     - Use rem as units for font instead of px for added accessibility usage. <br>
     - Dedicate more time utilizing wire frame to get a better overall product prior to beginning coding. <br>
